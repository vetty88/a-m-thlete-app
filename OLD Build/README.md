  DEV NOTES

  As an amateur athlete I want to track my results from playing numerous sports so that I can reflect on my season. I would also like to have a central area to share results with my team and have a chat about the game.  I would appreciate a community contributed calendar and results so that we can work together to record accurate events plans and outcomes
